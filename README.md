# Stitchme

## Description 

Here is a link to the deployed application on Heroku

https://stitchmeproject.herokuapp.com/

This is our application for the final project in the UW Coding Bootcamp. We created an application to help users organize their fiber arts (embroidery/crochet/knit/etc..) projects. Users can sign into their profile, upload a new project, and post todos, steps, and images of their project. We have two seperate repos, one for our backend using a mongo db and our front end was built using React. 

Screeshots of each page, with each theme are included in the images folder in SRC!
